The Datalogger_2039_RTOS_bkp.zip file is a version of the USB_HOST_HID_MSC_LCD_FLASH_RTC_ACC_TEMP3.zip code running on FreeRTOS CMSIS V1 (CMSIS V2 did not generate Debug messages for USB Host). Only the USB part has been separated for now.

This code is NOT usable (it's just a backup), only the first screen opens but it may not load the memory contents correctly, and it may also cause data loss from the W25Q64 FLASH EEPROM memory.
