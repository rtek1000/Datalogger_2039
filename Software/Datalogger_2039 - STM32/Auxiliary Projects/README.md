Datalogger2039_FW_F4_1.27.1_basic_proj:
- Just base automatically generated by STM32CubeIDE, added LOG output function on serial port UART1
- Device Configuration Tool Code Generator can be used without affecting manually added code


Datalogger2039_FW_F4_1.27.1_mini_kd_added:
- Do not use the Device Configuration Tool Code Generator, parts of the core code have been changed outside of the automatic generation delimiters
- The Datalogger2039_FW_F4_1.27.1_basic_proj project has been modified to recognize more than one HID interface
- Reference project: https://github.com/rtek1000/STM32F4HUB_modified/
